Background
======
I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Peking University in June 2025, following a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2020. I was also a visiting student researcher at UC Berkeley from January to May 2024. My research focuses on causal inference, with particular interest in methods such as identification of causal effects using auxiliary variables and non-Gaussianity, causal peer effects, mediation pathway selection, data fusion, and factorial instrumental variables. I enjoy engaging in conversations with people from diverse backgrounds, as it allows me to gain fresh perspectives on a wide range of topics.
